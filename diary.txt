  the supervisor

10/FEB/23
- added friends model

- add_friend view added to account/views.py
- added url pattern for adding a friend

- friend list now displayed on the profile page
- add friend button displayed next to the name

- in order to accept friend request, we need notification feature
- so we pause with the friend feature here, and it's time to implement notification feature

- did some research and found out I don't need push notification as this is a website, it is more suitable to use notification feature where it's only visible when user is in the web app

- I'm gonna use Django Channels for web socket

- time to learn how to use Django Channels

20/FEB/23
- installed channels and setting environments

- created 'notifc' which is an app for notification feature

- My plan is to follow the official Django Channels document's tutorial which
  is a chat app using websocket.

21/FEB/23

- I'm not getting any of the official documents so am watching youtube videos
  and tutorials on channels
- i need to learn about websockets and async mechanics first

30?/FEB/23

- watching some easy explanation in my first language for better understanding

10/MAR/23

- deleted the whole practice project because it got all tangled as I was
  practising with many different tutorials
- created new venv and project to start fresh for learning

- followed the official channels document chat app tutorial
- it works and I'm feeling like I understand better than a month ago
- but i don't feel like I should go straight into my main project with the
  risk of ruining it
- thus my plan is to do another practice project, but this time on my own and
  also not chat app but an actual notification app
- but i don't wanna do it today so for today let me do fun designing

- completed practice for dropdown menu that I'm planning for notification

13/MAR/23

- resuming my notification practice project

- it's not as simple as I thought it would be
- struggling.

14/MAR/23

- resuming from where I left off

- for some reason it's not recognising channels and daphne that I've clearly
  installed
- trying to fix it but stackoverflow is no help rn

- for some reason, I had to install channels and daphne globally not in my
  venv. it's weird... why is it not looking it from my venv lib folder?

- resuming the practice

- it does not work, i don't know what's the problem
- let's do some other things for now

- match participants system complete

- not 100% sure what daphne does
- and redis too

- finally it's working, not correctly, but at least there's websocket
  connection established

- I'm getting the notification in the console, I can see it but it's not
  displaying??

15/MAR/23

- so the websocket is real-time thing, but it's ONLY real-time thing... why
  did I think it's gonna be stored automatically
- so that means I need to save it to the db and fetch it from db?
- but then when I need to list the notifications I need to check the new
  notifications in db real time? there's no point of async in that case... and
also that's nonsense, performance would be so bad

- the clever way (and maybe the only way) was to fetch from db, but also put
  real time ones on the top of the list but for user it will feel like they
are the same thing. so now it's time to save them to the db

- websockets request are sent twice??? why..? it's saved in the db twice too
  cus it's calling receive function twice every time a user join a match.

- seems like that's how it works as it's two users websocket connected to each
  other?

- the ultimate solution was to save it to the db when send the notification...
  not when a user receive it. simple but very efficient wow.

- testing this is so tiring.. I can't make match for every single time I test.

- created view for leaving a match and added a leave button

16/MAR/23

- now it's time to show red dot in the notification button when there's new
  notifications

- establish websocket connection when the user connect to the website, not
  just in the notification page

- some struggle but it works now

- documentation for django
- installed sphinx
- learning how to use it

- created documentation to see if it works
- it works but so many unwanted documents
- gotta tidy up in the future...

- it's time to begin writing reports

- following up on the feedbacks received for interim reports

- chapter 3 software dev methodology completed
- tried to write more so that I can get some feedback for supervisor meeting
  tomorrow but it's not possible I need sleep

17/MAR/23

plan, I need to justify it though
